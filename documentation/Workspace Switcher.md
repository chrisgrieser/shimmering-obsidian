# Workspace Switcher
**`ow`: Switch to a different `w`orkspace**
- Displays a list of your workspaces. Select one to open the workspace.
- You can also manage your Workspaces from here, i.e. saving, loading & deleting a workspace.
- Using the [workflow configuration](documentation/Workflow%20Configuration.md#Misc) `workspace_to_spellcheck`, you can define one workspace as a "spellcheck workspace". This means every time you switch to that workspace via `ow`, Spellcheck will be turned on, and every time you switch to a *different* workspace, spellcheck will be turned off.
- Using `ow`, you can also simply toggle Obsidian's built in spellcheck.
