# Documentation & Forum Search

## Documentation & Hub
**`oh`: Get `h`elp by searching the official [Obsidian documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Start+here) and the [Obsidian Hub](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub).**
- This command mimics the search behavior on the official documentation site, meaning that it also searches for headings inside individual documentation pages.
	- Press `↵` to open in your default browser.
	- Use `⌥ + ↵` to copy the link to your clipboard instead. When the [workflow configuration](Workflow%20Configuration.md#Miscellaneous) `discord_ready_links` is set to `true`, the copied link will be surrounded with `<` `>` for more convenient pasting in the Discord Desktop app (disables auto-preview).
- After major updates of the Obsidian documentation, this Alfred workflow needs to recreate its index of the Obsidian documentation. You can do so by selecting the respective option when typing keyword `oupdate`. (Index recreation can take a few seconds depending on your internet connection. You will be notified when it is done.)

## Forum Search
**`of`: Browse or Search the official [Obsidian `f`orum](https://forum.obsidian.md/s).**
- Search in a category: Select a category and press `↵`. Afterwards, you will be prompted to enter a search query. Confirm with `↵` to open that search in your default browser.
- Press `⌘ + ↵` to open the forum category in your default browser.
- Use `⌥ + ↵` to copy the link to the category to your clipboard instead. When the [workflow configuration](Workflow%20Configuration.md#Miscellaneous) `discord_ready_links` is set to `true`, the copied link will be surrounded with `<` `>` for more convenient pasting in the Discord Desktop app (disables auto-preview).
