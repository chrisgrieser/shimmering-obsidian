## Installation
*This workflow requires the Alfred 5 with [Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/).*
1. Install the Obsidian plugins [Advanced URI](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-advanced-uri) & [Metadata Extractor](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=metadata-extractor). Enable both plugins.
2. Verify you have not renamed your Obsidian config folder, meaning it is still `.obsidian` (Settings ‚Üí About ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Override config folder).
3. Download the [latest release at GitHub](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-obsidian/releases/latest). Double-click the `.alfredworkflow` file to install it.
4. Run the Alfred Command `osetup` and select the vault you want to control with *Shimmering Obsidian*. Obsidian then restarts. (Even if you have only one vault, you need to confirm that one vault once before you can use the workflow.)

## Credits
- Big shout-out to [@kometenstaub](https://github.com/kometenstaub) for developing the [metadata extractor plugin](https://github.com/kometenstaub/metadata-extractor), as this workflow is its main client.
- Also thanks to [@Vinzent03](https://github.com/Vinzent03) for his invaluable [Advanced URI plugin](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri), which enables Alfred to control various aspects of Obsidian.
