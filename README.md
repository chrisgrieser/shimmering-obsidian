## Workflow Installation
*This workflow requires the [Powerpack for Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/). Furthermore, version 3+ of this workflow requires Alfred 5, workflow version 2.27 being the last version supporting Alfred 4.*
1. Install the Obsidian plugins [Advanced URI](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-advanced-uri) & [Metadata Extractor](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=metadata-extractor). Enable both plugins.
2. Download the [latest release at GitHub](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-obsidian/releases/latest). Double-click the `.alfredworkflow` file to install it.
3. Run the Alfred Command `osetup` and select the vault you want to control with *Shimmering Obsidian*. Obsidian will then restart. (Even if you have only one vault, you need to confirm that one vault once before you can use the workflow.)

## Configuration
There are extensive settings to configure everything to your hearts content.

I also designed some [themes for Alfred](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/alfred-themes) you can check out.

## Credits & Thanks
- Big shout-out to @koala for developing the [metadata extractor plugin](https://github.com/kometenstaub/metadata-extractor), for which this workflow is right now the main client.
- Also thanks to [@Vinzent03](https://github.com/Vinzent03) for his invaluable [Advanced URI plugin](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri), which enables Alfred to control various aspects of Obsidian.
