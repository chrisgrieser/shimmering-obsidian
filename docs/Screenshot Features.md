## OCR Screenshots
**`Triggered via Hotkey`: Take an OCR Screenshot.**
- Similar to the default Mac Hotkey `âŒ˜ â‡§ + 4`, you will be able to select part of your screen for a screenshot. However, instead of saving a screenshot, a new note will be created which contains the OCRed content of the selection.
- For best results, you should set the languages to be recognized in the workflow settings, e.g. `eng+deu` for English and German. You can find out the code for your language(s) in [this list](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files-in-different-versions.html).
- ðŸ’¡ There are various settings in the workflow configurations for OCR-screenshots.

### Requirements
For the OCR-Screenshot Feature, you need to install [Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html). If you use Homebrew, you can do so with the following two commands:

```bash
brew install tesseract
brew install tesseract-lang # for non-English languages
```

ðŸ’¡ *The first time you use the OCR or image screenshot feature*, you might need to give Alfred permission to record your screen. You can do so under the macOS system settings (see image below).

## Image Screenshot
**`Triggered via Hotkey`: Take an Image Screenshot.**
- Similar to the default Mac Hotkey `âŒ˜ â‡§ + 4`, you will be able to select part of your screen for a screenshot. The image will be directly saved in your vault with the file name `Screenshot {date} {time}.png` and the image will be embedded (`![[image_file_name.png]]`) in the note `Images.md` in your vault root.
- The images will be saved in `{vault-path}/screenshots/` by default. You can use the workflow configuration to specify a folder in your vault where to save the images instead.
- If the file `Images.md` already exists in your vault root, any subsequent screenshots will instead append to this note. This is intended for taking screenshots in quick succession, e.g., during a live lecture or presentation.
- ðŸ’¡ There are various settings in the workflow configurations for screenshots.

## Setting up Hotkeys
At the top left of the workflow, there are some sky-blue fields. You need to double-click them to set the keyboard shortcuts you want to use for the respective commands.

ðŸ’¡ To stay in line with the other macOS keyboard shortcuts for taking screenshots, you can use something like `âŒ˜â‡§ + 1` as hotkey.
