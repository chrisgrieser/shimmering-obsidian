## OCR Screenshots
**`Triggered via Hotkey`: Take an OCR Screenshot.**
- Similar to the default Mac Hotkey `‚åò ‚áß + 4`, you will be able to select part of your screen for a screenshot. However, instead of saving a screenshot, a new note will be created which contains the OCRed content of the selection.
- The *absolute* path set in the [workflow configuration](Workflow%20Configuration.md#Screenshot-Features) `ocr_screenshot_file` determines where the the text resulting from the OCR  will be saved to. When empty, will save the text to the file `{vault-path}/OCR-Screenshots.md`. If the file already exists, any subsequent OCR screenshots will instead append to the note.
- You can change the prefix to OCR screenshots by changing the [workflow configuration](Workflow%20Configuration.md#Screenshot-Features) `ocr_prefix`.
	- Use a different date format by following [Alfred's Placeholder-Syntax](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/placeholders/#date-time).
	- You can leave `ocr_prefix` empty or insert any other fixed value (e.g., a YAML-Header).
	- üí° While not very visible, the workflow configuration variables *do* accept multi-line values.
- For best results, you should set the proper languages to be recognized with the workflow setting `ocr_languages`, e.g. `eng+deu` for English and German. You can find out the code for your language(s) in [this list](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files-in-different-versions.html).
- When the [workflow configuration](Workflow%20Configuration.md#Screenshot-Features) `open_after_screenshot` is set to `true`, then the note will be opened after taking the screenshot. üí° Set this to `false` to take OCR screenshots in quick succession without opening Obsidian, e.g., during a live lecture or presentation.

### Requirements
For the OCR Screenshot Feature, you need to install [Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html). If you use Homebrew, you can do so with the following two commands:

```bash
brew install tesseract
brew install tesseract-lang # for non-English languages
```

üí° *The first time you use the OCR or image screenshot feature*, you might need to give Alfred permission to record your screen. You can do so under the macOS system settings (see image below).

## üÜï Image Screenshot
**`Triggered via Hotkey`: Take an Image Screenshot.**
- Similar to the default Mac Hotkey `‚åò ‚áß + 4`, you will be able to select part of your screen for a screenshot. The image will be directly saved in your vault with the file name `Screenshot {date} {time}.png` and the image will be embedded (`![[image_file_name.png]]`) in the note `Images.md` in your vault root.
- The images will be saved in `{vault-path}/screenshots/` by default. You can use the [workflow configuration](Workflow%20Configuration.md#Screenshot-Features) `screenshot_path` to specify the *absolute* path of a folder in your vault where to save the images instead.
- If the file ‚ÄúImages.md‚Äù already exists in your vault root, any subsequent screenshots will instead append to this note. This is intended for taking screenshots in quick succession, e.g., during a live lecture or presentation.
- When the [workflow configuration](Workflow%20Configuration.md#Screenshot-Features) `open_after_screenshot` is set to `true`, then the note will be opened after taking the screenshot. üí° Set this to `false` to take OCR screenshots in quick succession without opening Obsidian.

## Setting up Hotkeys
At the top left of the workflow, there are some sky-blue fields. You need to double-click them to set the keyboard shortcuts you want to use for the respective commands.

üí° To stay in line with the other macOS keyboard shortcuts for taking screenshots, you can use something like `‚åò‚áß + 1` as hotkey.
