# Workspace Switcher
**`ow`: Switch to a different `w`orkspace**
- Displays a list of your workspaces. Select one to open the workspace.
- You can also manage your Workspaces from here, that is, saving, loading &
  deleting a workspace.
- Unsurprisingly, this workflow requires the [Workspaces Core Plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Workspaces) to be enabled.
