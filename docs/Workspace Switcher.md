# Workspace Switcher
**`ow`: Switch to a different `w`orkspace**
- Displays a list of your workspaces. Select one to open the workspace.
- You can also manage your Workspaces from here, i.e., saving, loading & deleting a workspace.
- Unsurprisingly, this workflow requires the [Workspaces Core Plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Workspaces) to be enabled.

**Triggered via Hotkey: Quick Workspace Switcher**
- Set `Workspace 1`, `Workspace 2`, and `Workspace 3` in the workflow
  configuration and select hotkeys for them
- The hotkeys will automatically switch to the workspace. Note that the current workspace is not saved and that the hotkeys only work in Obsidian itself.
