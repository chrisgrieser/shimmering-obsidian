## Open & Create your CSS Files
**`ocss`: Access your `css` files.**
- Open a theme or CSS snippet in your default text editor.
- Access the “themes” or “snippets” folder located in `.obsidian` in Finder.
- Create a **new CSS snippet** in mere seconds: The CSS file will be placed in your snippet folder, filled with your clipboard content, named after the query you enter after `ocss`, and then opened in your default text editor. Furthermore, this will open the Obsidian Settings in the background, to save you yet another click. 🙂

## Theme Search
➡️ Refer to the [Plugin & Theme Search](Plugin%20and%20Theme%20Search.md#Themes) for information on the theme search capabilities.
- Useful for 🎨 theme designers will be the `fn + return` command to quickly download any theme's CSS.
