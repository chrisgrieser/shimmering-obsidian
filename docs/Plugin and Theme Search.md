## Plugins
**`op`: Combined Search of community `p`lugins and community themes.**
- Press `‚Üµ` to open the plugin in Obsidian's Community Plugin Browser.
	- Use `‚åò + ‚Üµ` to open the plugin's GitHub repository instead.
	- Press `‚å• + ‚Üµ` to copy the plugin URI (`obsidian://show-plugin?id=‚Ä¶`) to your clipboard. When Discord is the frontmost app, the copied link will be surrounded with `<` `>` for more convenient pasting in the Discord Desktop app (disables auto-preview). (This does not work with Alfred's Compatibility Mode.)
	- `‚áß + ‚Üµ` to display & search the GitHub issues. See [the section below](#searching-github-issues) for more information.
	- *Holding* `‚åÉ` will display download numbers, author, and plugin ID. This is useful, when the plugin description is so long that you cannot see it anymore.
	- *‚öôÔ∏è For developers:* *Pressing* `‚åÉ+‚Üµ` will copy the plugin ID to the clipboard.
- Only plugins officially included in the community plugins are displayed ‚Äî plugins solely available via GitHub or still in review are not shown.
- Add `plugin` to the search query to only display plugin, e.g., use `op focus plugin` as search query to only display *plugins* with the term `focus`.
- The `op` search also considers the name of the plugin's author, meaning the query `op JaneDoe` returns all plugins (and themes) authored by the user `JaneDoe`.

üí° To open local plugin folders and access settings of beta plugins, use the [Settings & Local Plugin Search](Settings%20and%20Local%20Plugin%20Search.md).

## Searching GitHub Issues
**Triggered by pressing `‚áß + ‚Üµ` on a plugin or theme. Displays a list of its GitHub issues.**
- The list displays the open/closed status, author, and number of comments.
- You can search for issue title, state ("closed" / "open") or author. You can also search for an issue number by prepending `#`, e.g. `#42`.
- You can also choose to create a new issue, pre-populated as Feature Request or Bug Report.
- Use `‚å• + ‚Üµ` on an issue to copy the issue URL to the clipboard.
- üí° To avoid unnecessary issues, the creation of new issues is *disabled* when the local version of the plugin is outdated. Instead, you are provided with a quick shortcut to update the plugin üôÇ
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Due to restrictions of the GitHub API, only the most recent 100 issues can be displayed.
