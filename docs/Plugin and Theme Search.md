## Discord Links
- When using `‚å• + ‚Üµ` to copy a link and Discord is the frontmost app, the link
  is surrounded in angle brackets (`<>`), which disables Discord's annoying
  auto-preview.
- When using `‚å• + ‚Üµ` while Discord is frontmost, or when pressing `‚åò‚å• + ‚Üµ`, the
  plugin name and description is added to the copied link for convenient
  sharing.
- Note that to detect whether Discord is the frontmost app, [Alfred's
  compatibility mode](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/appearance/) needs to be
  *disabled*. If you need to use compatibility mode, use `‚åò‚å• + ‚Üµ` to force
  copying nice, sharable links.

  also possible to search for an issue number by prepending `#`, such as `#42`.
- You can also choose to create a new issue, pre-populated as Feature Request or
  Bug Report.
- Use `‚å• + ‚Üµ` on an issue to copy the issue URL to the clipboard.
- üí° To avoid unnecessary issues, the creation of new issues is *disabled* when
  the local version of the plugin is outdated. Instead, you are provided with a
  quick shortcut to update the plugin üôÇ
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Due to restrictions of the GitHub API, only the most recent 100 issues can
  be displayed.
