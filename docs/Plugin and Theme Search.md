- Only plugins officially included in the community plugins are displayed ‚Äî plugins solely available via GitHub or still in review are not shown.

- The `op` search also considers the name of the plugin's author, meaning the query `op JaneDoe` returns all plugins (and themes) authored by the user `JaneDoe`.

üí° To open local plugin folders and access settings of beta plugins, use the [Settings & Local Plugin Search](Settings%20and%20Local%20Plugin%20Search.md).

## Discord Links
- When using `‚å• + ‚Üµ` to copy a link and Discord is the frontmost app, the link will be surrounded in angle brackets (`<>`), which disables Discord's annoying auto-preview. 
- When using `‚å• + ‚Üµ` while Discord is frontmost, or when pressing `‚åò‚å• + ‚Üµ`, the plugin name and description will be added to the copied link for convenient sharing.
- Note that to detect whether Discord is the frontmost app, [Alfred's compatibility mode](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/appearance/) needs to be *disabled*. If you need to use compatibility mode, use `‚åò‚å• + ‚Üµ` to force copying nice, sharable links.

## Searching GitHub Issues
**Triggered by pressing `‚áß + ‚Üµ` on a plugin or theme. Displays a list of its GitHub issues.**
- The list displays the open/closed status, author, and number of comments.
- You can search for issue title, state ("closed" / "open") or author. You can also search for an issue number by prepending `#`, e.g. `#42`.
- You can also choose to create a new issue, pre-populated as Feature Request or Bug Report.
- Use `‚å• + ‚Üµ` on an issue to copy the issue URL to the clipboard.
- üí° To avoid unnecessary issues, the creation of new issues is *disabled* when the local version of the plugin is outdated. Instead, you are provided with a quick shortcut to update the plugin üôÇ
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Due to restrictions of the GitHub API, only the most recent 100 issues can be displayed.
