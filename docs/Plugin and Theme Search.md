## Plugins
**`op`: combined Search of community `p`lugins and community themes.**
- Press `⏎` to open the plugin's GitHub repository.
	+ Use `⌘ + ⏎` to open .the plugin in Obsidian's Community Plugin Browser
	  instead.
	+ Press `⌥ + ⏎` to copy the plugin URI (`obsidian://show-plugin?id=…`) to
	  your clipboard.
	+ `fn + ⏎` to open the plugin's page at [Obsidian Stats](https://www.moritzjung.dev/obsidian-stats/).
- Only plugins officially included in the community plugins are displayed —
  plugins solely available via GitHub or still in review are not shown.
- Add `plugin` to the search query to only display plugin, for example, use `op
  focus plugin` as search query to only display *plugins* with the term `focus`.
- The `op` search also considers the name of the plugin's author, meaning the
  query `op JaneDoe` returns all plugins (and themes) authored by the user
  `JaneDoe`.

💡 To open local plugin folders and access settings of beta plugins, use the
[Settings & Local Plugin Search](Settings%20and%20Local%20Plugin%20Search.md).

## Themes
**`op`: Combined Search of community `p`lugins and community themes.**
- Press `⏎` to open the theme's GitHub repository in the browser.
	+ Use `⌘ + ⏎` to open the theme browser instead. (There are no separate
	  theme pages in Obsidian Theme Browser that can be opened.)
	+ Press `⌥ + ⏎` to copy the theme URI (`obsidian://show-theme?id=…`) to your clipboard.
	+ Use `⇧` or `⌘ + Y` to open a Quick Look Preview of the theme's promo
	  screenshot. Press `⇧` or `⌘ + Y` again to close the preview.
	+ `fn + ⏎` to open the theme's page at [Obsidian Stats](https://www.moritzjung.dev/obsidian-stats/).
- Only themes officially included in the community themes are displayed — themes
  solely available via GitHub or still in review are not shown.
- Add `theme` to the search query to only display themes, for instance use `op
  focus theme` as search query to only display *themes* with the term `focus`.
- The `op` search also considers the name of the theme's author, meaning the
  query `op JaneDoe` returns all themes (and plugins) authored by the user
  `JaneDoe`.

## Discord Links
- When using `⌥ + ⏎` to copy a link and Discord is the frontmost app, the link
  is surrounded in angle brackets (`<>`), which disables Discord's annoying
  auto-preview.
- When using `⌥ + ⏎` while Discord is frontmost, or when pressing `⌘⌥ + ⏎`, the
  plugin name and description is added to the copied link for convenient
  sharing.
- Note that to detect whether Discord is the frontmost app, [Alfred's
  compatibility mode](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/appearance/) needs to be
  *disabled*. If you need to use compatibility mode, use `⌘⌥ + ⏎` to force
  copying nice, sharable links.
