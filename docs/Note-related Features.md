## ✴️ Create a new Note
**`on`: Create a `n`ew note.**
- __File Name:__ Anything you type after the keyword `on` (e.g., `on foobar`) will become the filename of the new note (e.g., `foobar.md`).
- __Content:__ The [workflow configuration](Workflow%20Configuration.md#note-related-features) (`template_note_path`) determines the content of the new note.
- 🆕 __Location:__ The new note will be placed in the folder specific in the [workflow configuration](Workflow%20Configuration.md#note-related-features) `new_note_location`. If the configuration is left empty, it will be placed in your vault root.
- This command also works with Obsidian not running (in which case it will open Obsidian after note creation).
- If you have set the [workflow configuration](Workflow%20Configuration.md#note-related-features) `use_quickadd` to `true`, this command will instead trigger the [QuickAdd Plugin](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd). Anything you type after the keyword `on` (e.g., `on foobar`) will be passed to search the QuickAdd choices. File Name, Location, and Content will be determined by QuickAdd and not this workflow.

## Scratchpad
**🆕 `oo` or `triggered via hotkey`: Append to your Scratchpad Note**
- Quickly add text to the note set in the [workflow configuration](Workflow%20Configuration.md#note-related-features) `scratchpad_note_path`. This command is basically a quick version of the `fn + ↵` mode of the [Alfred-based Quick Switcher](Alfred-based%20Quick%20Switcher.md#search-for-notes).
- When using `oo`, will append the text entered into Alfred.
- When triggered via hotkey, will append the current selection.
- The text set in the [workflow configuration](Workflow%20Configuration.md#Alfred-based-Quick-Switcher) `append_prefix` will be inserted in front of the input text.
	- 💡 Using `- [ ]` enables you to add cards to a Kanban Note.
- If the [workflow configuration](Workflow%20Configuration.md#Alfred-based-Quick-Switcher) `open_after_appending` is set to `true`, will open the scratchpad afterwards.

## Daily Notes
**`od`: Open & Append to today's daily note [settings].**
- Either open today's daily note or append to today's daily note.
- This feature works without Obsidian running, since when appending, your daily note will not be opened.
- Use `cmd + ↵` to open your daily note after appending to it.
- This does *not* require the Daily Notes plugin to be enabled.
- For now, the daily notes must be exactly in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` for this feature to work.
- Using the [workflow configuration](Workflow%20Configuration.md#note-related-features) `daily_note_path`, you can set the location of your daily notes inside your vault.
- The text set in the [workflow configuration](Workflow%20Configuration.md#Alfred-based-Quick-Switcher) `daily_note_append_prefix` will be inserted in front of the input text.

## Move Note
**`om` or `triggered via hotkey`: Move the current note to a different folder in your vault.**
- This fully replicates the functionality of the `Move File to another folder`.
- 💡 The reason for this command is that the `Move File to another folder` is only available when the file explorer core plugin is enabled. However, some users of this Alfred workflow (including myself) prefer to fully navigate their vault via Alfred, so that the file explorer isn't really needed anymore — the move command is basically the last thing stopping you from simply deactivating the file explorer plugin.
