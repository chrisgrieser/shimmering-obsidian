## Create a new Note
<!-- LTeX: enabled=false --><!-- vale off -->
__`on`: Create a `n`ew note.__
<!-- LTeX: enabled=true --><!-- vale on -->
- __File Name:__ Anything you type after the keyword `on` (for example, `on foobar`) becomes the file name of the new note (for example, `foobar.md`). (Note that the [Filename Heading Sync Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-filename-heading-sync) may interfere with this.)
	- When triggered via `cmd + ‚Üµ`, the new note is created in a new tab.
- __Content:__ You can select a template note to use in the workflow configuration. Only `{{title}}` is supported as placeholder and is replaced with the file name. Be aware that the template might be overridden by Folder Templates from the [Templater plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=templater-obsidian).
- __Location:__ The new note is placed in the folder specified in the workflow configuration. If the configuration is empty, it is placed in your vault root.
- üí° There are various settings for creating new notes in the workflow configuration.

## Scratchpad
__`oo` or `triggered via hotkey`: Append to your Scratchpad Note__
- Quickly add text to the note set in the workflow configuration. (This command is basically a quicker version of the `fn + ‚Üµ` mode of the [Alfred-based Quick Switcher](Alfred-based%20Quick%20Switcher.md#search-for-notes).)
	- When using `oo foobar`, appends `foobar` to the note.
	- Triggered via __hotkey__, appends the current selection.
	- When you append `#foobar` (for example, `Inbox/Scratchpad-Note#Thoughts`) to path of the scratchpad file in the workflow configuration, the text is appended to the section with the heading "foobar."
- üí° Using `- [ ]` as prefix and inserting below a specific heading enables you to add cards to a Kanban Board.
- üí° There are various settings for the scratchpad in the workflow configuration.
