## Backup your Vault
**`obackup`: Create a `backup` of your vault.**
- Your whole vault is compressed into a *zip* file and then moved to the location you specified in the workflow configuration.
- This command respects the maximum number of backups you have set (workflow configuration `max_number_of_bkps`) to prevent taking up too much disk space. When the number is reached, every new backup causes the oldest backup to be deleted.
- The hidden folders `.obsidian` and `.trash` are included in the backup, the `.git` folder is excluded.
- ðŸ’¡ Advanced users: you can use the following AppleScript snippet to trigger a backup. This is useful to create automated backups via [launchd](https://launchd.info/), [Cron jobs](https://ostechnix.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cron-jobs/), or [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/).

```applescript
tell application id "com.runningwithcrayons.Alfred"
	run trigger "backup-obsidian" in workflow "de.chris-grieser.shimmering-obsidian"
end tell
# pass 'no sound' as argument to turn off backup confirmation sound
```
