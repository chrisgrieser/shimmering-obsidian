# Vault Switcher

**`ov`: Open `V`aults in Obsidian, Finder, or the Terminal**
- Select a Vault and press `↵` to open it in Obsidian.
	- `⌘ ⏎` opens the root of the selected vault in your default Terminal. You can [change the default terminal in the Alfred Settings](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/terminal/).
	- `⌥ ⏎` opens the root in Finder.

> [!NOTE]  
> In previous versions, `⇧ + ⏎` was used to switch which vault you would control/search. Since version 3.13, this is not supported anymore. To control/search a different vault, you have to select a different vault in the workflow configuration.
