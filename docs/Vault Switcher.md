# Vault Switcher

**`ov`: Open `V`aults in Obsidian, Finder, or the Terminal**
- Select a Vault and press `↵` to open it in Obsidian.
	- `⌘ + ↵` will open the root of the selected vault in your default Terminal. You can [change the default terminal in the Alfred Settings](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/terminal/).
	- `⌥ + ↵` open the root in Finder.
	- `⇧ + ↵` to control the selected vault with _Shimmering Obsidian_. (This Alfred workflow can only work on one vault at the same time.) The requirements (Metadata Extractor, Advanced URI) need to be installed in any vault you want to control.
